# RateTunableCBFs
This repository supplements our paper [Rate-Tunable Control Barrier Functions: Methods and Algorithms for Online Adaptation ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12966). Simulation videos are provided below. More instructions on how to run the code will be added soon!

## Simulation Results
The ego agent (red) navigates to its goal location while performing collision avoidance with other agents (black).


- Standard method
- The CBF-QP becomes infeasible although the robot is still safe

- Proposed method
  The proposed method is able to adapt the parameters and maintain feasibility of controller at all times
